# Project Title-W 08 Smart Dustbins
Effective waste management begins with efficient waste segregation. With the development of the human race, waste generation has increased at an alarming rate. If steps won't be taken now, the health and living conditions will start deteriorating. Our solution will help in reducing the impact of careless waste segregation and also give our clients some perks which will further motivate them to use our system for the betterment of our environment. 

This is the track which we implemented to the solution:-
a.User login into Dustbin 2.0 via monitor.If you are a new, you have to register to receive some amazing credits.
b.User is directed to first Window where they have to fill up basic details like username,password and user will be redirected to next window with a continue button,signifying that users data has been saved.
c.User now will be select the type of waste which they wish to deposit.(Plastic/Wet/Dry)
d.The IR camera will click images of the waste(which is put into the slit) & PythonAi(FastAi) will detect the type of waste using dataset and segregates the waste accordingly.
e.User receives an update with the credits added to his/her account.(More the waste, more the credits).
f.User can redeem these credits at any e-commerce website.
